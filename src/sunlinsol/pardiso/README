                     SUNLINSOL_PARDISO
                 not released as part of SUNDIALS
    SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers
                   Release 3.1.0, March 2018


PARDISO implementation of the SUNLINSOL module for SUNDIALS. 

SUNLINSOL_PARDISO defines the content field of SUNMatrix to be a structure 
containing X, along with a long integer for any error flag that arises in
the factorization process.

SUNLINSOL_PARDISO defines N macros to provide access to the content of 
a PARDISO SUNLinearSolver, and constructor for the PARDISO SUNLinearSolver
interface, in addition to implementation of all linear solver
operations defined by the generic SUNLINSOL module in the table 
of operations.

THE FORTRAN interface IMPLEMENTATION is incomplete and DOES NOT WORK!
