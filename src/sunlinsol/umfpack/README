                     SUNLinSol_UMFPACK
                 not released as part of SUNDIALS
    SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers
                   Release 5.3.0, July 2020


UMFPACK implementation of the SUNLinSol module for SUNDIALS. 

SUNLinSol_UMFPACK defines N macros to provide access to the content of 
a UMFPACK SUNLinearSolver, and constructor for the UMFPACK SUNLinearSolver
interface, in addition to implementation of all linear solver
operations defined by the generic SUNLinSol module in the table 
of operations.

There is no FORTRAN interface implementation!

The ReInit and Space methods are dummy implementation.

A. Documentation
